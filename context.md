# Anti-Ransomware Framework Design

## Core Architecture

The anti-ransomware tool is designed with a platform-independent core and platform-specific implementations. This design allows for:

1. Common detection logic and scoring across operating systems
2. Platform-specific monitoring mechanisms
3. Unified response capabilities

### Operational Modes

- **Standalone Mode**: Direct execution with real-time feedback and interactive controls
- **Daemon Mode**: Background monitoring service for continuous threat protection

## Detection Components

The detection system combines three major components:

1. **Syscall/API Monitoring**
   - File operation patterns (read-write-delete sequences)
   - Cryptographic API usage
   - Backup/shadow copy deletion attempts
   - Registry modifications (Windows)

2. **Memory Analysis**
   - Detection of encryption code patterns in memory
   - Monitoring of dynamic code injection
   - Memory protection changes

3. **Process Behavior**
   - Process creation and relationship monitoring
   - Command-line argument analysis
   - Network connection monitoring for C2 communication

## Scoring System

The scoring system employs a weighted approach to evaluate potential threats:

- Base scores for individual suspicious events
- Pattern multipliers for sequences of related activities
- Time-based scoring factors (rapid operations = higher scores)
- Severity thresholds for different response levels

### Key Scoring Factors:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| File Operations | 0.5 | Mass file access, modification, renames |
| Entropy Changes | 0.7 | Increases in file entropy after writes |
| Crypto API Usage | 0.6 | Use of encryption/decryption functions |
| Memory Changes | 0.4 | Suspicious memory allocation, protection |
| Network Activity | 0.3 | Connections to suspicious destinations |
| Backup Access | 0.8 | Attempts to delete backups/shadow copies |
| Registry Changes | 0.4 | Windows registry modification patterns |

### Response Thresholds:

- **Low (30+)**: Begin enhanced monitoring, log suspicious activity
- **Medium (60+)**: Alert user to suspicious behavior, prepare for intervention
- **High (80+)**: Isolate process network access, prompt for user action
- **Critical (95+)**: Automatically suspend or terminate process

## Platform-Specific Implementation Notes

### Linux Implementation

- Using ptrace for syscall interception
- Filesystem monitoring with inotify
- Process monitoring via /proc filesystem
- Memory monitoring via /proc/[pid]/maps

## Linux Monitoring Implementation

### Syscall Monitoring

The Linux implementation uses `ptrace` to hook into critical system calls that might indicate ransomware activity:

| Syscall | Purpose | Monitoring Goal |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| execve | Process execution | Track new process creation, command parameters |
| open/openat | File access | Monitor files being accessed, particularly sensitive documents |
| read | File reading | Track which files are being read before modification |
| write/pwrite64 | File writing | Detect content changes and potential encryption |
| rename/renameat | File renaming | Detect extension changes (.doc → .encrypted) |
| chmod/fchmod | Permission changes | Detect attempts to lock files by changing permissions |
| unlink/unlinkat | File deletion | Identify deletion after encryption |
| mkdir/mkdirat | Directory creation | Monitor for ransom note creation directories |
| rmdir | Directory removal | Detect cleanup activities |

### Detection Patterns

The detection engine analyzes sequences of syscalls to identify ransomware behavior:

1. **Read-Encrypt-Write Pattern**: Process reads file, processes content, writes back encrypted data
2. **Mass Operation Pattern**: Rapid sequence of similar operations across many files
3. **Extension Modification Pattern**: Systematic changing of file extensions
4. **Entropy Increase Pattern**: File content becomes more random after write operations

### Memory Monitoring

Memory monitoring focuses on:

1. Tracking memory regions through `/proc/<pid>/maps`
2. Detecting new RWX (read-write-execute) memory regions
3. Identifying memory regions with encryption code patterns
4. Monitoring for code injection techniques

### Process Hierarchy Analysis

Process monitoring tracks:

1. Parent-child relationships between processes
2. Command-line arguments of suspicious processes
3. Short-lived processes performing file operations
4. Unexpected process creation chains

### False Positive Reduction

The false positive filtering system:

1. Maintains process and application whitelists
2. Tracks normal user behavior patterns
3. Applies contextual scoring based on process reputation
4. Filters out known good operations (backups, updates, etc.)

### Linux-Specific Scoring Adjustments

| Behavior | Base Score | Multiplier Conditions |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| Sequential file operations | 5 | ×2 if >10 files/second, ×3 if >50 files/second |
| Extension changes | 15 | ×2 if known ransomware extensions (.locked, .encrypted) |
| RWX memory allocations | 10 | ×2 if in non-developer processes |
| Process spawning shell | 8 | ×2 if shell spawns further processes accessing files |
| High file entropy after write | 20 | ×1.5 if multiple files show entropy increases |

### Windows Implementation

- API hooking for file/registry operations
- ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) for system events
- Memory monitoring with VirtualQueryEx
- Process creation monitoring with WMI

## Future Scope

- Machine learning component for adaptive detection
- Cloud-based threat intelligence integration
- Ransomware recovery capabilities
- Remote management console for enterprise deployments
- Encryption behavior simulations for testing
